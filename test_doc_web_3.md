# Third test document from web UI

This is a third tiny test document.

It mentions:
- embeddings and pgvector
- FastAPI endpoints for ingest and chat
- Cloud Run services for RAG
- a simple web UI with two forms

Use this file to check that the workspace can handle multiple uploaded documents
and that the chat can answer questions using all of them together.
