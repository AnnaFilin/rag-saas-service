# Fourth test document from web UI

This is a fourth tiny test document.

It mentions:
- RAG service architecture
- separation of ingestion and chat services
- Neon Postgres with pgvector for embeddings
- a minimal web UI split into styles.css and main.js

This file is used to test that refactoring the frontend into separate CSS and JS
did not break the ingestion and chat flows.
