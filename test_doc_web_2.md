# Another test document from web UI

This is a second tiny test document.

It mentions:
- RAG backends
- Cloud Run services
- Neon Postgres and pgvector
- Web UI with ingest and chat

Use this file to check that a new workspace or an existing one
can hold multiple documents and still answer questions correctly.
