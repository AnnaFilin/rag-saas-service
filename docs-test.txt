RAG SaaS – Docs Upload Test

This document is used to test the Docs upload pipeline.

Key facts:
- The system uses FastAPI and Postgres with pgvector.
- Documents are ingested via POST /ingest-file.
- Each document belongs to a workspace.
- After ingestion, the document is split into chunks and stored in the database.

Expected behavior:
- Upload should succeed.
- Chunks count should be greater than zero.
- The document should be available for retrieval in Chat.
